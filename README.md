# Data_Cleaning-
Cleaned a raw dataset by removing duplicates, standardizing formats, handling null/blank values, and dropping irrelevant columns to prepare the data for analysis


ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Project

In this project, I worked on cleaning a raw dataset to prepare it for analysis. The main steps included:

    Removing Duplicates
    Identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

    Standardizing Data
    Unified formatting across the dataset (e.g. consistent casing, date formats, etc.) to ensure consistency.

    Handling Null/Blank Values
    Replaced, removed, or imputed missing and blank values based on the context of each column.

    Dropping Unnecessary Columns
    Removed irrelevant or redundant columns to reduce noise and simplify the dataset.
